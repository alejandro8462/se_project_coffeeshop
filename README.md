# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. I had a lot of fun building this project. I really learned a lot. There were lots of times were I got stuck and I would get so frustrated because I couldn't figure something out but then the solution ended up being something so simple. I know that this is just the beginning so I'm very excited to continue learning more and getting better at HTML and CSS, and soon Javascript.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

An idea that I have for improving the project is to include more pictures and position them in interesting places throughout the webpage because positioning is what I struggle with the most. Making the header and nav links "sticky" so that the user is able to click into different parts of the webpage from any point, they don't have to scroll back up to press "Book A Table". Also, more animations in other parts of the webpage would look really cool. Instead of just the single animation in the about section, maybe there could also be an animation for the logos.
